	Exception: DBから生成したラベルと楽譜から生成したラベルに不整合があります。ログファイルを参照して修正して下さい
	Exception: There is an inconsistency between labels generated from DB and labels generated from score. 
	Please refer to the log file and fix it.
		
		make sure your LABs are on time with the USTs. 
		If you use lab2ust, make sure you set the TEMPO of the empty UST BEFORE running the program.
